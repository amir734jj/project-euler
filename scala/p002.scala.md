Problem #2
    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
    By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

    By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Solution:
    The Fibonacci sequence is equal to F0 = 1, F1 = 2 and Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2. The basic optimization we can do is to
    use memoization to address repeat calculation; however it does not solve the even values number issue in an optimal manner.
```

```scala
object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    var cache = Map[Int, Int]()

    def fib(n: Int): Int = cache.getOrElse(n, {
        val result = n match {
          case 1 => 1
          case 2 => 2
          case _ => fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
        }

        cache += n -> result
        result
      })

    for (i <- 1 to 100) {
      fib(i)
    }

    println(cache)
  }
}
```
