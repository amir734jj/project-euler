The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

Solution: we can follow Sieve of Eratosthenes approach by starting from 2 as a prime number and then finding the next larger
prime factor, then the next larger prime factor until we found largest prime factor
```

```scala
object HelloWorld {
  def factors(n: Long, current: Int) = Stream.from(current)
      .takeWhile(k => k * k <= n)
      .find(n % _ == 0)

  def largestPrimeFactor(n : Long, current : Int = 2): BigInt = {
    factors(n, current) match {
      case None => n
      case Some(k) => largestPrimeFactor(n / k, k)
    }
  }
  
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println(largestPrimeFactor(600851475143L))
  }
}
```
